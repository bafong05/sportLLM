## How-to: 
You just run it from terminal and interact with the chatbot. 

Say you just finished building a LEGO set and you have leftover pieces. You don’t want these going to waste, so what do 
you do with them? That’s what our chatbot is for. Our chatbot is trained by a dataset that contains information on which 
parts are included in different LEGO sets. It contains LEGO parts, sets, colors and inventories of every official LEGO 
set in the Rebrickable database. Say you a bunch of leftover random pieces from different completed sets and want to build 
something with them. Running our chatbot, you would type in “I have 20 2x2 bricks and 5 4x2 bricks”. The chatbot would 
collect the data from the database, output recommendations of sets to build with your inventory, and give a brief summary 
of why this set was recommended.

## Sources 
We used LangChain for the basic chatbot and then Kaggle to link it up with a dataset.
After understanding what was going on and making the code act as a chatbot in the terminal,
I asked chatGPT to format and re-order the code to make it clean and presentable.

## ChatGPT Success Score
Final Average Score: 7.3/10
